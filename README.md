Skyblockle is a Wordle-like daily game for Hypixel Skyblock weapons.<br>
The goal of the game is to guess the Weapon of the Day based on the stats and matches found throughout the game.<br>
For every guess, each cell will appear as <span class="green">green</span>, <span class="yellow">yellow</span>, or <span class="red">red</span> depending on if the specific value matches.<br>

**Green** means the stat matches with the WOTD.<br>
**Yellow** (only for ability) means the guessed weapon shares only one ability (if either the weapon guessed or the WOTD have 2 abilities).<br>
**Red** means that the stat is wrong. For <img src="img/SkyBlock_icons_strength.png" height="14px"><span class="red">Damage</span> and <img src="img/SkyBlock_icons_strength.png" height="14px"><span class="red">Strength</span>, there will be arrows (↑/↓) indicating whether the guessed weapon's stat needs to be higher or lower to match the WOTD's corresponding stat.

## Clarifications

* The only Categories included are **Sword**, **Bow**, **Longsword** and **Gauntlet**. <br>
* Weapons with the "Wand" category (or "offensive wands") are **not** included, since this category is mostly for support items. Skyblock is very inconsistent, so only wands in the "Sword" category are included.<br>(To see a list of weapons this excludes, check <a href="https://wiki.hypixel.net/Wands#All_Wands" target="_blank">here.</a>)<br>
* Items who have damage stats but aren't considered weapons (Fishing rods, Pickaxes, Axes...) are **not** included.<br>
* Weapons that drop directly from **dungeon clear** enemies, **Daedalus Blade**, and **Great Spook Sword** are **not** included, since they have 0 stats by default.<br>
* Skyblock versions of Vanilla weapons are **not** included.<br>
* Abilities that aren't indicated by "Ability: " in the item's description are **not** counted.<br>An exception to this are the Wither Blades, these are listed as **Right click**.<br>
* Abilities without an activation, "On Shoot" or "On Hit" are all considered **passive** for consistency.<br>
* Since the Blaze Slayer daggers come in pairs with identical stats, these are grouped into "**T1/T2/T3 Blaze Daggers**". <br>
If you've guessed one of them, you won't be able to guess the other one. Any other cases of items with identical stats <i>are</i> counted separately, so make sure to pay attention to the alert box.
